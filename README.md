# ValidationOfUserLogin

Project objective:

Create a servlet-based web application that shows a login page and validates it. The correct values are hard-coded. On successful login, a dashboard page is shown. The dashboard will provide a link for logging out. Incorrect logins need to be handled by showing an error message page.

Background of the problem statement:

As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, you have to prototype a login scenario for the user. There is no database involved here, so you have to use fixed values for login email id and password.
